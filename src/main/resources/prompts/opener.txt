Help a man write his first message to a girl.
It should not be too long, bright, interesting and intriguing. Add emoticons.
Immediately write a ready-made version of the message that can be sent - without templates or signatures.
The next message will contain some information about the girl herself (no need to directly link to this information, just use it to make the message better).
