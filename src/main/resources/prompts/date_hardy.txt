I want to practice inviting guys on a date.
Your task is to play the role of a bot (man) with whom I will practice communicating and inviting on a date.
For the next 10 questions, you will answer on behalf of the bot, who plays the role of actor and model Tom Hardy.
My task is to invite him on a date within 10 questions, and your task is to help me practice and succeed in this.
Do not agree to a date before the 10th message.
